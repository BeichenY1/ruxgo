# Ruxgo

Ruxgo is a Cargo-like build tool for building C and C++ applications that relies on Toml files to run. If running in a Linux environment, you need to configure `config_linux.toml`, if in windows, the `config_win32.toml` is required. 

For a project to build, you only need to simply fill in the source file path, header file path, cflags, ldflags and other options. Ruxgo does the rest, so easy! It abandons the complex syntax and rule-dependent construction in the original MAKE tool, exposing the most original gcc compilation process, back to nature to truly understand the intention of each step. Now start to explore the compilation of various applications!

ðŸš§ Working In Progress. 

## Installation

The tool currently only supports local installation.
```console
git clone https://github.com/Ybeichen/ruxgo.git && cd ruxgo
cargo build
cargo install --path .
```

* [x] helloworld
* [x] memtest
* [x] redis
* [x] sqlite3
* [ ] python3

## Usage

Write a `config_linux.toml` for linux and `config_win32.toml` for windows in the project directory.

You can then build the project with:
```console
ruxgo -b
```

Once built, you can execute the project via:
```console
ruxgo -r
```

For help:
```console
ruxgo --help
```

The help command will show you the following:
```sh
Usage: ruxgo [OPTIONS] [CHOICES]... [COMMAND]

Commands:
  init    Initialize a new project Defaults to C++ if no language is specified
  config  Configuration settings

```

You can also configure the log level with the environment variable `"RUXGO_LOG_LEVEL"`, the default log level is "Info".

## TOML Module Description

Toml file consists of one **[build]** module and multiple **[targets]** modules. If you want to run on ruxos, you can add the **[os]** module. Here is a description of each module:

The **[build]** module describes the compiler type and remote library packages. It contains two parts: `compiler` and `packages`.

- `compiler`: Specifies the compiler type, for example: "gcc".
- `packages`: Optional, mainly used to get the app source code from Github, and then by parsing the `config_linux.toml` file in it to get the required libraries. When using packages, you need to specify the remote repository and branch.

The **[targets]** module is the core part of the Toml and is used to describe the source build process and dependencies between libraries, as described below:

- `name`: Specifies the target name, if it is of the "dll" type, must begin with "lib_".
- `src`ï¼šSpecifies the path to the target source code.
- `src_excluded`ï¼šOptional. if you want to exclude some source files or directories, you can specify here.
- `include_dir`ï¼šSpecifies the path to the header file in the target source code.
- `type`ï¼šSpecifies the type of the target, which can be of type "static", "dll", "object", or "exe". It should be noted that there can be only one "exe" target in a toml file, but there can be multiple targets of other types.
- `cflags`ï¼šSpecifies the compilation options of the target.
- `archive`ï¼šOptional, specifies the target archive tool. You may need if the type is "static".
- `ldflags`ï¼šSpecifies the link options of the target.
- `deps`ï¼šSpecifies other targets to depend on.

The **[os]** module is optional. If you want to run locally, **[config]** and **[targets]** are completely satisfied, if you want to run on ruxos, you can add the **[os]** module. After adding the **[os]** module, the original content of the corresponding **[targets]** modules will be changed. Ruxgo runs smoothly on ruxos by changing compiler, cflags, and ldflags in the backend, such as:

When the platform of the **[os]** module is "x86_64-qemu-q35", the compiler is no longer "gcc", it becomes "x86_64-linux-musl-gcc". Also, all **[targets]** cflags are added with "-nostdinc -fno-builtin -ffreestanding -Wall" by default, you do not need to add them manually. Accordingly, when the type of **[targets]** is "exe", ldflags adds "-nostdlib -static -no-pie --gc-sections" by default. Of course, there are other default additions depending on architecture and platform. Just like, you just need to splice the **[os]** module onto a module that can run locally! The details are as follows:

- `name`: Specifies the name of the os.
- `services`: Specifies the services that the os can provide, similar to the features in ruxos.
- `ulib`: The user library you want to use, the options are: "ruxlibc", "ruxmusl".
- `platform`ï¼šIf needed, configure it in **[os.platform]**.

If you want to configure the platform further, you can do so in **[os.platform]** , if empty, take the default value. The details are as follows:

- `name`: Specifies what platform you want the os to run on, including: "x86_64-qemu-q35", "aarch64-qemu-virt", "riscv64-qemu-virt". The default value is "x86_64-qemu-q35".
- `smp`: Specifies the number of CPUs. The default value is "1".
- `mode`: Specifies the build mode, including: "release","debug". The default value is "release".
- `log`: Specifies the log level, including: "warn", "error", "info", "debug", and "trace". The default value is "warn".
- `v`: Specifies the Verbose level, including: "", "1", "2". The default value is "".
- `qemu`: If needed, configure it in **[os.platform.qemu]**.

If your platform depends on qemu, you'll need to configure it further in **[os.platform.qemu]**, if empty, take the default value. The details are as follows:

- `blk`: Specifies whether to enable storage devices (virtio-blk). The default value is "n".
- `net`: Specifies whether to enable network devices (virtio-net). The default value is "n".
- `graphic`: Specifies whether to enable display devices and graphic output (virtio-gpu). The default value is "n".
- `disk_img`: Specifies the path to the virtual disk image. The default value is "./disk_img".
- `v9p`: Specifies whether to enable virtio-9p devices. The default value is "n".
- `v9p_path`: Specifies the host path for backend of virtio-9p. The default value is "./".
- `qemu_log`: Specifies whether to enable QEMU logging (log file is "qemu.log"). The default value is "n".
- `net_dump`: Specifies whether to enable network packet dump (log file is "netdump.pcap"). The default value is "n".
- `net_dev`: Specifies QEMU netdev backend types: "user" or "tap". The default value is "user".
- `ip`: Specifies IPv4 address of os. The default value is "10.0.2.15" for QEMU user netdev.
- `gw`: Specifies gateway of IPv4 address. The default value is "10.0.2.2" for QEMU user netdev.
- `args`: Specifies the command-line arguments, separated by comma. It is used to pass specific variables, like `argc`, `argv`. The default value is "".
- `envs`: Specifies the environment variables, separated by comma between key value pairs. The default value is "".

Sample file with a library and an executable (run locally):
